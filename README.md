I save all my music locally on my phone. No Spotify or Apple Music or whatever for me. Spotify is highway robbery for musical artists. So I make playlists on my phone. These playlists are not synced with my computer. I want to sync them with my computer via a few clicks of buttons. How do I do that?

Enter this app. It scans my Music folder on my phone for .m3u files (playlists), formats the filepaths contained within so they'll point to music when they land on my computer, and launches them up to Google Drive after authenticating with Google. Boom, bam, bop, bada-bop boom pow. Now I can access my playlists on my computer and the whole process took 40 seconds.

I'm am is a genius,,
